## Twitch Clone 
This project was developed just for study purposes, in the process i used React, Next, Typescript and Styled-components. Looking to continue my trajectory as a front-end developer, i decided to all in on ReactJs. Looking for inspirations and ideas I entered the challenge of cloning the [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/) site, mainly to practice the Components.
<br/><br/>
## What I've learned
Most of the time, in order to extract as much detail as possible, within my current capacity, I've beenon DevTools. In a period of 5~10 days I went from HTML and CSS to learning React using the most current tools on the market. Yeah, a roller coaster. With the knowledge acquired and the experience gained, I will be using in future projects of best practices and techniques, always looking to the best result.
<br/><br/>
## How can i see it
The project was deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com), you can check the page on https://twitch-volpatocode.vercel.app or u can just download/fork here, install the dependencies by typing "npm install" and run it with "npm run dev". As it was a project with the purpose of studying componentization, I didn't take the time to make it responsive, it was made to be viewed on a Full HD desktop.
